Hey All! I'm thinking of picking up a new manga, and since our current manga is pretty popular, I was thinking I could recruit other people on Otakoi and the two of you could work on the new one. Of course, I won't force anyone to do anything, so this is only if you like the new manga and you're fine with handing over Otakoi.

The new manga is by the author of [Busu ni Hanataba wo.](https://mangadex.org/title/b8272d78-498e-477c-8835-548d3f2370e4/busu-ni-hanataba-wo). Not sure if you've read it. The translation so far has been pretty rough, but it's a good manga.

The author's new manga is [Koisuru 2DK, Ayakashi Zensai Tsuki.](https://mangadex.org/title/13e03584-eb63-4545-af36-89040751c075/koisuru-2dk-ayakashi-zensai-tsuki). The main characters are adults this time, but they have a similar vibe as the previous manga. The woman is a plain, hardworking, and competent person, and the man is nice and well intentioned, but very clumsy at a lot of things. (A himbo, if you will.)



The woman has just broken up with her long time boyfriend after he cheated on her and got another woman pregnant. She moves in to a new apartment, and in that building she meets the man who is a single father of twins.

She relies on him in this troubling time, and she repays him by helping out with parenting duties he's not skilled at.

The twist in this manga is - his ex-wife's ghost is still around, and tries to scare away any potential suitors for her husband. It's a very odd setting, but it makes for a lot of heartwarming moments.
